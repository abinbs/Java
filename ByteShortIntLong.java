/*
* Byte - byte is the smallest data type for storing integers
*
* Short - short can store bigger values than byte but less then int data type
*
*  Int - int data type is most common for storing in storing integers
*
* Long - We use long for extremely large numbers
*
* Note:The long data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer.
Its value-range lies between -9,223,372,036,854,775,808(-2^63) to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807(2^63 -1)(inclusive).
Its minimum value is - 9,223,372,036,854,775,808and maximum value is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
Its default value is 0.

The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer.
Its value-range lies between -32,768 to 32,767 (inclusive).
Its minimum value is -32,768 and maximum value is 32,767.
Its default value is 0.
